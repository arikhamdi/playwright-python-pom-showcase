## 📋 Project Overview
This is a E2E (End-to-End) testing framework built with **Python**, **Playwright**, and **Pytest**. 
It follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Page Object Model**: Decouples test logic from UI selectors.
- **Fail-Fast Principle**: Environment variables are validated before test execution.
- **CI/CD**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated regression testing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Framework**: Pytest
- **Tool**: Playwright
- **Reporting**: Pytest-HTML with automated GitHub Pages deployment
- **Security**: Environment variables validation (Fail-Fast)
- **Pattern**: Page Object Model (POM)
