[![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/arikhamdi/playwright-python-pom-showcase/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arikhamdi/playwright-python-pom-showcase/actions)

## 📋 Project Overview
This is a E2E (End-to-End) testing framework built with **Python**, **Playwright**, and **Pytest**. 
It follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Page Object Model**: Decouples test logic from UI selectors.
- **Fail-Fast Principle**: Environment variables are validated before test execution.
- **CI/CD**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated regression testing.
